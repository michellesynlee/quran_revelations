Order of Revelations Finder

For my Global Core Class, the Quran, finding the order or revelations for all the surahs assigned each class took a lot of time, which this code solves using python + pandas!
- Converted pdf to xlsx
- Read the xlsx using pandas
- Convert into multiple dicts
- Find corresponding surah-revelations based on key-values
- Create a range by finding min/max
